# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    - I feel very confident in my understanding of for statements.  
<br/>
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?  
    - It felt very good to connect prior knowledge and learning. I struggled for a bit with figuring out ho to connect a for statement and an if statement because I wanted to try to figure it out without using Google before immediately looking for the answer online. I went back to the conditionals assignment, refreshed my memory there and then tried my best in solving the challenge. I got close but then turned to Google once I couldn't quite get it to work. Once I figured out how to add an if statement into a for a statement, the rest of the assignment was smooth sailing. I think the entirety of my struggle with this assignment was productive, especially since I learned from it.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?  
    - I need to practice making sure that I reference the index position for the variables in the array when I want to manipulate them using an if statemnt inside of a for statement. I found myself trying to add methods to the variables without adding `[i]` to reference the index position, and that was causing my code not to work. I am glad I am aware it's something I need to practice, and I can add it to the study time I have available on my calnedar tomrorow.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - I am curious about how for statements get applied to code when they are doing something other than logging to the console. For example, I am curious to know if for statments can be used to call functions. I am going to do some research online to look for the answer.
